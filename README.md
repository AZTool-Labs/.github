# ZKGarage

## Making Zero-Knowledge Technology Accessible Across Platforms

ZKGarage is an emerging open-source initiative focused on simplifying access to zero-knowledge cryptography through developer-friendly SDKs. Our mission is to bridge the gap between complex cryptographic primitives and practical application development, enabling privacy-preserving applications across multiple platforms.

## Current Focus

We're currently developing our first SDK, **Aztec.dart** - a Flutter package that enables mobile developers to integrate zero-knowledge proofs and Aztec Network functionality into cross-platform applications. This initial project establishes our foundation for expanding to other platforms.

### Aztec.dart Features

- Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification using Noir
- Seamless Aztec Network integration
- Account and asset management
- Private transaction support
- Cross-chain functionality
- Comprehensive security features
- Flutter UI components


## Our Vision

While we're starting with Aztec.dart, our roadmap includes expanding to multiple platforms to create a comprehensive ecosystem of zero-knowledge tools:

- **Aztec.swift** (Planned) - Native SDK for iOS and macOS
- **Aztec.kt** (Planned) - Kotlin SDK for Android
- **Additional platforms** as the ecosystem grows


Our goal is to maintain consistent APIs and functionality across all platforms, allowing developers to leverage their knowledge regardless of their preferred development environment.

## Why ZKGarage?

Zero-knowledge technology represents a powerful solution for preserving privacy in digital interactions, but implementation complexity has limited adoption. ZKGarage aims to solve this by:

1. Creating SDKs that abstract cryptographic complexity
2. Building with a security-first mindset
3. Fostering a community of privacy-focused developers
4. Providing educational resources about zero-knowledge concepts


## Getting Involved

As a new organization, we welcome contributors who share our vision for privacy-preserving technology:

- **Code contributions** to Aztec.dart
- **Documentation improvements**
- **Feature suggestions** for our roadmap
- **Testing and feedback**


## Early-Stage Roadmap

1. Complete core functionality for Aztec.dart
2. Build documentation and examples
3. Develop reference applications showcasing real-world use cases
4. Begin work on additional platform SDKs
5. Create educational content about zero-knowledge concepts
